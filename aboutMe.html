<div class="About">
  <p><br>I am Catherine Gichina and i am a student at AkiraChix<br>
  I am an avid reader who likes to emmerse herself in pyschology<br>
 thriller novels.<br>
  I find joy in the little things around me like star gazing at night<br>
meditation and good food.<br>
Just like everyone else,i have my fears.Fear of small crawling animals <br>
and then the fear of failure.However,i acknowledge that fear is innevitable.<br>
Fear is a response of the body towards something but being afraid is a choice.<br>
A choice to hold on to fear.</p>
<p>I enjoy giving out my time to serve the community by volunteering in different<br>
exchange programmes.</p>

<br>
<div class="Me">
  <p>I come from  a small family of four.I appreciate that because one of the most valuable<br>
  gifts given to humanity is life.<br>
   I enjoy farming as i have been raised from an agricultural background.Both my parents<br>
  are poultry farmers.I enjoy the business side of poultry farming and seeing how business<br>
evolves with time,patience and effort.
 I would like to come up with an app that helps small scale farmers to improve on their yield<br>
and monitor their farm animals at the comfort of their mobile phones.</p>

<div class="More">
  <p>One thing i have learned about myself is that i enjoy real estate.<br>
  I love seeing how different decors and lightings can bring life to a room and change the ambience of a room.<br>
I enjoy doing business too through making different investments and finding ways to increase financial assets.<br>
 Seating with people and hearing their different views of certain topics gives me a different perspect and views<br>
makes me learn something new about someone or a certain topic that i would not have learnt on my own. </p>
