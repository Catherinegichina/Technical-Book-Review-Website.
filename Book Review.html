 <p>Trevor Noah uses humour to illustrate how his relationship with his mum was like Tom and Jerry.
     He explains how his mum was a strict disciplinarian and would give hiding through throwing things 
     at Trevor and chasing while screaming "Stop Thief!" for everyone to grab him and tackle him.
