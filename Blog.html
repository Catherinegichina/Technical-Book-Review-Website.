   <h2>BlOG 1 REVIEW</h2>
 <p>Back in Tazeen,Abel was brought up in the Tsonga culture which was extremly patriachal community where women were all traditional,stay at home moms.
<br>I am talking about a world where women must bow when they greet a man and where men were not allowed in the kitchen.
<br>Abel being the first born son,was treated with a level of respect as the dad's 
surrogate.Since it was his big homecoming with Andrew,his first born son,<br>he expected
Patricia,his wife,to play her traditional role but she refused.<br>
Despite the cultural noms that dictated the place of the woman,Patricia Noah was a free
roaming spirit who hunged out with men and talked to them as equals.<br>
Traditional men like Abel even in todays world tend to want control and power over a woman.<br>
Despite having having submissive women back in Tanzeen,Abel sort to put out the fire in Patricia Noah by restraining her
from doing the things she loved most for instance:<br>Going to church and spending the day there.<br>
 He felt a need to be in power and in control despite having an open minded,free spirit woman like Patricia.
 He failed to see that it was out of love that Patricia opted to stay with him.She was willing to pour out herself
 towards having a family but that was in vain in the hands of a traditional man like Abel.<br>
His behaviour is therefore represented by a bird collector who catches birds,only to put them in a cage.
In my opinion,women should give their level of respect to men.However,that does not mean having to endure pain,
disrespect or having to lose oneself.<br>
After putting up with abel's abusive behaviour,Patricia Noah finally left with Andrew.Not only did she leave Abel,<br>
but she also started a new relationship in her new environment.I personally think that was such a brave move from Patricia Noah.
<br>Women in todays world go through this male chauvenism too.They stay in abusive relationships for the sake<br>
of their children ,the man is the soul provider of the family  or they are scared to take a brave step and walk away.<br>
While other men believe in taking care of a woman emotionally,pysically and spiritually,other men are good at destroying<br>
other women in the name of "subjugating them" or putting them in their "place"<br>I am a strong believer of education.Wht?Because knowledge is power.Educating the girl child on the power she owns within herself and that her<br>
matters too will reduce the rate of domestic violence in homes.Teaching her the power of knowing her rights will open her mind to new and <br>
different perspectives in  her life and relationship with other people.</p>
